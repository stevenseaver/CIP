            <p>In our current economy, we take resources from the mother nature, manufactured a product (with its corresponding wastes), people buy it and throw it as a waste eventually. Its linear, and all the waste has to go somewhere right? Well guess what, they went to the ocean. This practice is not sustainable and harming our planet. With circular economy, we thrive to revolutionize the industry for the better and made it more circular, more sustainable.

            <p>Circular economy implies three major points: reducing waste to a minimum, circulate products, and regenerate the nature. In the production stage, manufactures should design a system where production waste should not enter the municipal landfill, but to be recycled again with the goal of minimizing waste. When a product reaches the end of its life, its materials are recycled to be used again and again, thereby creating further value. With all this steps implemented, we hope we can help regenerate the environment.</p>

            <p>Our production facilities incorporate minimum waste philosophy. Every waste ever produced by our production facilities are immidiately sorted based on materials and colors to increase the likelyhood to be recycled. After that, the waste are reprocessed as raw materials to be reused. </p>

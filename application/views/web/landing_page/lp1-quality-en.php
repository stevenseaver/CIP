            <p>Plastic market is volatile, hence a sudden rise (or drop) on material prices can affects finished product's price and/or quality. While other manufacturer reduce their quality when the material price rises, we strive to keep the same quality standards throughout our production batch. Recycled plastic materials also are not quite consistent compared to virgin materials, hence we have to had flexible manufacturing formula to create a better uniformity in our finished products quality to ensure customer's satisfaction</p>
            <p>Maintaining product quality requires robust and cost-effective production method. In the start of production process, we formulate best possible materials based on our previous batch archive. Then we run a production trial to see if the product's quality is acceptable. During our production processes, we incorporate Kaizen, a continual improvement on product's quality and minimizing waste wherever possible. And we also have 8 series of Quality Control measures; one QC checkpoint from production trial, 3 on extrution process, 3 on cutting and packaging process, and one more on outgoing process.</p>
            <p>With extensive production method, how are we able to maintain our cost-effective jargon? By recycling and reusing our waste of course. In 2021 alone, we manage to save more than 19.6 ton of plastic waste that otherwise would've been thrown to industrial landfill. We successfully sort all the production waste and recycle it into a usable raw materials, hence reducing both the production cost and our environmental impact.</p>
